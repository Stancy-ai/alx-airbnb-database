## Entity Relationship (ER) Diagram of an Airbnb clone Project





This Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram outlines the visual representation of the database structure of an airbnb platform. It models the relationships between key entities:

Users (guests, hosts, admins)
Properties listed by hosts
Bookings made by users
Payments linked to bookings
Reviews left by guests
Messages exchanged between users

Together, these tables define the schema needed to support essential features like user registration, property listings, reservation handling, secure transactions, user feedback, and communication.
